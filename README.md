# Unreal Physics Project

This project showcases 2 physics based minigames made using Unreal Engine 5.6 and the blueprint visual language.

## Game 1: Tilting Maze (Myahm Agana Shrine - The Legend of Zelda : Breath of The Wild)

This minigame is based off the Myahm Agana Shrine in the Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild. It features a maze you can tilt using your arrow keys, allowing you to navigate a ball inside it to reach an exit. If the ball falls off the maze, you go back to the beginning. This minigame showcases gravity and how collisions affects object velocity as well as collision detection..

## Game 2: Bubble Maze (Bubble Blast Galaxy - Super Mario Galaxy)

This minigame is based off the Bubble Blast Galaxy in Super Mario Galaxy. You control an airhorn with your mouse, and can blow air to push around a bubble in a maze. Making any contact with obstacles puts you back to the beginning. This minigame showcases the use of UE's radial force feature as well as collision detection.

## Challenges

The main challenge with this project was writing complex gameplay code in Blueprint. C++ not being allowed, things that could take one line in C++ now need 10 nodes in Blueprint, which makes it difficult to organize. Mapping out the levels was also challenging, I had to rely on my level designer instincts to make something fun for both minigames.
